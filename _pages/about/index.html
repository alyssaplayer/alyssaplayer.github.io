I’m Alyssa, a data scientist who specialises in translating raw data into clear and strategic decisions. I rely on Python and R to build statistical models, machine learning workflows, and data visualisations using scikit-learn and the tidyverse.</p> <p>I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in the digital marketing, media, and entertainment industries. My background in scientific research has provided me with a strong foundation in hypothesis testing and experimental design, enabling me to develop robust, evidence-based models. Outside of work, I embrace my creative side by making art and music, or recharge by spending time outdoors.</p> </body></html>
